Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. a) Explain what software engineering is 
b) and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
## ANSWER ## 
a) This is when engineering principles, methods and tools of developing and maintaining high-end software systems are applied in a systematic manner or approach.
b) IMPORTANCE OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING TO TECHNOLOGY
    I) It aids communication, business development, entertainment and healthcare.
    II) It bridges the gap between man and machine.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
## ANSWER: MILESTONES IN THE EVOLUTION OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ##
A) The first milestone would be the development of programming languages like Fortran, C e.t.c. 
B) A second milestone would be the establishment of software engineering curriculum/discipline in the 60's.
C) The third milestone would be development of structured programming in the 70's.

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
## ANSWER: LIFE CYCLE IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ##
I) REQUIREMENTS: in this of the life-cycle system requirements and user needs are gathered and documented.
II) DESIGN: at this stage, a well detailed design of the software architecture and user interface are crafted.
III) IMPLEMENTATION: this stage involves the building and writing of the software code in accordance with the predetermined software design.
IV) TESTING: at the stage the software is tested before deployment to ensure that it meets quality assurance standards and functional requirements.
V) DEPLOYMENT: this stage comes after a successful test, where the product is released to the end users/customers.
VI) MAINTENANCE: this is the final stage whereby ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software product are done after deployment and this also feeds into the requirement phase again if an update/enhancement needs to be done on the product.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
## ANSWER ##
Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with a distinct phase flowing downwards


5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
## ANSWER ##

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
## ANSWER ##

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
## ANSWER ##

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
## ANSWER ##

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. a) Define prompt engineering 
b) and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
## ANSWER ##
a) Prompt engineering is the structurally designed set of instructions given to a robot/AI on how to go about certain task.
b) The importance is that it lets the AI give a more accurate representation of what you want it to perform.

2. a) Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. 
b) Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
## ANSWER ##
a) VAGUE PROMPT: ChapGPT draw me a round object in a rectangular space.
   IMPROVED PROMPT: ChapGPT draw a round leather ball, with patches of red and white colors and place it on a football pitch.
b) The improved prompt contains more information for the AI to model an accurate answer to my query.
